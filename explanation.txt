hi everyone ;)

this is my machine learning project toward predicting the prices of bigmart sales dataset which is gattered in 2013 
the files u are seeing inclues diffrend methods of data preprocessing and standardization . and also some data visua-
lization . 

in the comparinng_models.ipynb i didnt use standardization and i just compared 3 diffrent models as linear reg
Xgboost and random forrest and in the final rand for i chose random forrest as the final model and i used standardization 
on my data .



in the vizualization note book we have some analysis toward our dataset and by that information we chose the best visualization 
items like pie chart on items variety and quantity .
